## Magic Square - Genetic Algorithm
>  Genetic algorithm in solving magic squares

###### A magic square is a square array of numbers consisting of the distinct positive integers 1, 2, ..., n^2 arranged such that the sum of the n numbers in any horizontal, vertical, or main diagonal line is always the same number (Kraitchik 1942, p. 142; Andrews 1960, p. 1; Gardner 1961, p. 130; Madachy 1979, p. 84; Benson and Jacoby 1981, p. 3; Ball and Coxeter 1987, p. 193), known as the magic constant  M_2(n)=1/nsum_(k=1)^(n^2)k=1/2n(n^2+1).
